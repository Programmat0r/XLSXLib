<p>Not finished. Do not use this library in production!</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Read all cells of the first worksheet of a workbook</p>

```csharp
var workbook = new Workbook("Example/Testfile.xlsx");
workbook.Load();

foreach (var row in workbook.Worksheets[0].Rows)
{
    foreach (var cell in row.Cells)
    {
        Console.Write(cell.Value);

    }

}
```
